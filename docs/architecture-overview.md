## Modules
Apocryphh Discord Bot is broken down into three main modules:
1. Core - .NET 5.0 application based on Perper responsible for bot logic
2. Frontend - HTML / JS micro-fronteds used for presenting more complex data / interactions
3. Ethereum - Etheremum Parity Node used to send transactions and execute queries to Ethereum network

### Core
The core modules is implemented as a singe Perper Agent with the following streams:
1. Commands - using Discord.NET ingests slash commands from the bot
2. Events - using Discord.NET publishes events to the events channel
3. Voting - using Discord.NET publishes voting notifications to the voting channel
4. Ingest DAO Transactions - using Nethereum ingest Apocryph DAO related transactions in
Perper Fabric.

In addition to the streams we also have:
1. Queries - various filters on top of the ingested transaction data
2. Transactions - front-end controller generating IPFS URIs for singing transactions

### Frontend
Number of single page micro-applications based on HTML and Vue.js

### Ethereum 
Etherem parity node used as connection to Ethereum Network.

## Operations
The Core and the Ethereum modules are packaged as containers and 
are orchestrated using Kubernetes. The Frontend module is deployed 
and served using IPFS.

### Local Development
For local development purpose, it is recommended to use Docker and 
Docker Compose to launch the whole system on your development machine.
